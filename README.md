PAPER PROJECT: MONEY BANK FUNCTIONALITIES - WITHDRAW, DEPOSIT AND INSERT CARD USED: CARDBOARD, RUBBER BANDS, RUBBER PIPES, TOY MOTORS, BATTERY.

SOFTWARE BASED:
This C++ project implements a Context-Free Grammar (CFG) parser that checks if user-input sentences are grammatically valid. It uses predefined grammar rules (like S → NP VP) and text files containing categorized vocabulary (nouns, verbs, pronouns, etc.) to validate each sentence.
The parser identifies:
Invalid Word Type: if a word isn’t in the vocabulary files.
Invalid Structure: if the sentence doesn’t match CFG rules.
Valid Structure: shows a derivation tree of how the sentence is parsed.
The system includes a menu-driven interface, signup/login system, and uses BSTs and queues for managing data. All grammar resources and user data are handled via text files in a txt/ folder.This project demonstrates concepts in parsing, compiler design, file I/O, and data structures, making it a practical educational tool for understanding grammar-based parsing in C++.
